Back-End
* Why stripe needs a backend service: 
*publishable Key: is a way of telling the stripe library in the front end which account is makeing the payments 
*secret key: stored secreatly in our backend server{
    if people found the screte key{
        > They can make payment 
        > steal stripe payments
    }
    }
*Always sensative information in the backend and never in the front end
*API: is a url that gives us back data's(html/css/js in json format) from the backend
*Post Request: asking data to the backend
